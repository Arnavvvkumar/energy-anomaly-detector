# Energy Forecasting with Machine Learning

A comprehensive energy consumption forecasting system that demonstrates the difference between **fake results** (due to data leakage) and **honest results** (realistic forecasting performance).

## 🚨 Important: Data Leakage Analysis

This project originally claimed **100% accuracy**, which is impossible in real forecasting. The analysis revealed severe data leakage issues. This repository now contains the **honest evaluation** showing what realistic energy forecasting performance actually looks like.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
1. **Why 100% accuracy is impossible** in energy forecasting
2. **How data leakage occurs** in machine learning projects
3. **What realistic forecasting performance** looks like
4. **Proper methodology** for honest energy forecasting

## 📊 Honest Performance Results

| Model | Test MAE | Test RMSE | Test R² | Test MAPE |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Linear Regression** | **0.7354 kW** | **0.9903 kW** | **0.2160** | **82.61%** |
| **Random Forest** | **0.6568 kW** | **0.9460 kW** | **0.2846** | **60.18%** |

**These are REALISTIC results using ONLY time features (no data leakage):**
- MAE: 0.66-0.74 kW (realistic error)
- R²: 0.22-0.28 (explains 22-28% of variance)
- MAPE: 60-83% (realistic error rate)

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundations

### Feature Engineering Equations

**Lag Features:**
```
X_lag(t) = X(t - k) for k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 168}
```

**Rolling Statistics:**
```
μ_rolling(t, w) = (1/w) ∑(i=0 to w-1) X(t - i)
σ_rolling(t, w) = √[(1/w) ∑(i=0 to w-1) (X(t - i) - μ_rolling(t, w))²]
```

**Cyclical Encoding:**
```
hour_sin = sin(2π × hour / 24)
hour_cos = cos(2π × hour / 24)
```

**Ratio Features:**
```
power_ratio = Global_reactive_power / (Global_active_power + ε)
```

### Model Performance Metrics

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**
```
MAE = (1/n) ∑(i=1 to n) |y_i - ŷ_i|
```

**Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):**
```
RMSE = √[(1/n) ∑(i=1 to n) (y_i - ŷ_i)²]
```

**R² Score:**
```
R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot) = 1 - [∑(y_i - ŷ_i)² / ∑(y_i - ȳ)²]
```

### Accuracy Improvement Analysis

**Feature-to-Sample Ratio Optimization:**
```
Before: 576 features / 23,279 samples = 1:40 (problematic)
After: 50 features / 23,205 samples = 1:464 (optimal)
```

**Overfitting Reduction:**
```
Gap_reduction = |MAE_train - MAE_test|
Before: |0.2263 - 0.2873| = 0.061 (27% gap)
After: |0.0000 - 0.0000| = 0.000 (0% gap)
```
